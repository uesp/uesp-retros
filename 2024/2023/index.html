					<p>Last year saw the UESP continue to grow impressively, with the most notable milestone being breaking past 100,000 content articles. </p>
					
					<p>Checking <a href="https://wikistats.wmcloud.org/largest_html.php?th=0&lines=500">WikiStats</a>, that puts us as the 213th largest wiki overall at time of writing. However, keeping in mind that about 129 of the ones ahead of us are all different branches of Wikipedia, so we are arguably in the top 100 largest wikis in the world!</p>
					
					<p>From the official side of things, we saw the long-anticipated release of <a href="https://starfieldwiki.net/wiki/Starfield:Starfield">Starfield</a>, the ESO <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Necrom">Necrom</a> expansion, updates to Skyrim, and the surprise pre-release of The Elder Scrolls: <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Castles:Castles">Castles</a>.</p>

					<h1>Community</h1>

					<p>
						In total, <b>32,438 pages</b> were added to the UESP in the last year from community editors. That means almost <b>ten percent</b> of the UESP was created in just the last year alone! (~8.68% if you want to be more precise!) 
					</p>
					<p>
						For comparison's sake, the UESP has 373,448 pages in total, with that count also including support and technical pages.

					<p>
						We also had some major happenings from the wider TES community this year as well. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We saw the release of the latest <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Tamriel_Rebuilt:Main_Page">Tamriel Rebuilt</a> map, Andaram. The Elder Kings 2, a fan project bringing The Elder Scrolls to Crusader Kings 3, saw three major updates in the last year. Beyond Skyrim, Skywind, and Skyblivion jointly hosted Creation Mod Con. We also saw the release of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91428">Harthstone Isles</a> from the Arcane University. And while they have asked us not to say what it is yet, keep an eye out on <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a> in the near future for some big changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is just a small slice of what the rest of the larger Elder Scrolls community has been up to, it's truly amazing to see the love, creativity, and dedication from all of you out there.

								<h2 class="heading">CSlist expanded to support multiple languages</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										UESP started off the year by expanding our <a href="https://cslist.uesp.net/">CSList</a> game database to cover multiple languages.
										Some translated in-game texts can have drastic differences, as translators often end up working with outdated versions of texts. 
									</p>
									
									<p>One example comes from non-English versions of The Real Barenziah, which worked off of the Daggerfall version due to time constraints, and <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Real_Barenziah,_v_2">as such was never censored like the English equivalent</a>.</p>
		
									<p>We also hope this will help <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Hosted_Wikis"">UESP translation projects</a>, wherever they may arise. As one of the few clear options we have available to aid them without learning additional languages to build these wikis ourselves, we hope this will prove useful to them.</p>

									<p>
										The ESO team invites Dave Humphrey, founder of UESP, to a private playtest of the ESO:Necrom chapter. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Whilst there, he had the opportunity to ask community questions had about the expansion, and to see the technical side of things we don't see as much of. </p>
									</p>
									<p>
										Dave would later post his impressions on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/eso-necrom-81373305">12 Apr 2023</a> in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/eso-necrom-81373305">private Patreon post</a>.

							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										RobinHood70, wiki administrator and template wizard rewrote MetaTemplate - a major extension used in many of UESP's wiki templates. This work added some minor features, and brought it up to modern MediaWiki standards, allowing it to be more easily maintained in future.

								<div class="text">
									<p>
										Several community editors finished a months-long comprehensive overhaul of the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vivec">Lore:Vivec</a> page, which attempted to account for all the nuances and conflicting accounts of the Dark Elf Tribunal god Vivec’s origins and history. The revamp began April 28th, and the last major section was added June 29th.

							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										Dave migrated UESP.net to MediaWiki 1.30, the software that powers UESP.net under the hood. The update was part of the never stopping march of progress for mediawiki software. Whilst not a super exciting update, it allowed UESP.net to host and play midi files, which wasn't possible before. It also resolved an information coverage issue.

										It took 20 minutes in total, and no downtime was recorded.

										In early August 2023, UESP released a complete overhaul of our online <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Maps">interactive maps</a> system, which was over a year in the making. This was a close-to-ground-up rework of our map system, focusing on performance and mobile friendliness, as the old one was proving hard to navigate on mobile and had several bugs.
									</p>
									<p>
										The new release was roughly 50-60% faster than the older version, in addition to several improvements to accessibility and web standards.

										Perhaps the biggest challenge of the year for UESP was the launch of <a href="https://starfieldwiki.net/wiki/Home">Starfield Wiki</a>. 
										Prior to the launch of Starfield, we were hard at work getting Starfield Wiki up and running. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Starfield Wiki represents a big opportunity for us, as this is UESP's first wiki covering a Bethesda game other than The Elder Scrolls.
										We hope that documenting the game on its own wiki will give us some insights into the development of the Creation Engine ahead of the release of The Elder Scrolls VI. 
									</p>
									<p>
										We're really excited about providing a solid wiki for the community on this one, and seeing where Starfield goes in future!

					<h1>Thank You!</h1>

					<p>
						In 2023, UESP continued to be a leading source of information for Elder Scrolls fans. With over 100,000 content articles and a dedicated user base, we think that UESP.net is poised for even greater success in the years to come.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're looking forward to continuing to cover ESO content in 2024, ESO's 10th anniversary, the 30th anniversary of the Elder Scrolls, and some exciting new unannounced projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have a lot of things planned to make UESP even better than before! Thanks for your continued support!
