						Welcome to UESP's <b>2024 Retrospective</b>! This is the second year in a row we've done this, and just like <a href="https://retro.uesp.net/2023/">last time</a>, we're going to take a look back at some of the things we've done over this past year.

						<a href="https://wikistats.wmcloud.org/largest_html.php?th=0&lines=500">WikiStats</a> shows UESP has grown relative to the other wikis out there once again, but we don't have anything quite as interesting to point out like last year where we reached over 100K total articles. Still, we have seen substantial growth on that front, taking the 209th rank at the current time of writing with 107,883 articles. In total we have <b>32,555</b> new pages, which is pretty close to the number from last year.

					<p>
						The UESP is a constantly growing entity, with over 100,000 content pages! This retrospective can't go over everything that was added to the UESP last year, so we're going to try something a bit different this year. 
					</p>

					<p>
						We've reached out to some of our community editors, and asked them about some of the best updated or new pages on the wiki, and we wanted to spotlight them for you here!

					<h2>Featured Articles</h2>

					<p>
						The following are a selection of this year's <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Featured_Articles">Featured Articles</a>, which are articles the UESP's users deem to be of the highest quality and should be held up as an example for other articles. These articles help push the standards for the UESP further.

								<div class="content">
									<h3 class="title">Chrysamere</h3>
									<span class="description">Chrysamere (also called the Chrysamere Blade, or the Chrysamere) is an ancient adamantium claymore artifact with offensive capabilities only surpassed by its defenses. It has magical properties which, unlike most weapons, are defensive in nature: it heals the wielder, grants them resistance to fire, and reflects hostile spells. It is unaligned, and is not a Daedric artifact. Chrysamere was forged in the late Merethic Era by the Breton swordsmith Asterie Bedel, who delighted in using the techniques of both man and mer in her creations.</span>

								<div class="content">
									<h3 class="title">Ayleid Empire</h3>
									<span class="description">The Ayleid Empire (or imperatum saliache) was the original dominant power in Cyrod. It was composed of multiple city-states, ruled by the Ayleid sorcerer-kings. The empire's roots began in the Middle Merethic Era, when established Ayleid settlements flourished in the Heartlands. Though they were ostensibly a tribute-land to the High King of Alinor, the distance between Cyrodiil and Summerset's communication lines led to the Ayleids' isolation and eventual detachment. Their fall is attributed to their arrogant pride of their achievements and smug self-assurance that their empire would last forever, which doomed them to fail and fade into obscurity.</span>

He is the main antagonist of ESO, and is attempting to pull Nirn into his realm of Oblivion, Coldharbour, in an event known as the Planemeld. Molag Bal has stolen the soul of the player, forbidding them to die. To reclaim your soul, you must save Tamriel from the Prince's clutches.</span>

					<h2>Gold Road</h2>

					<p>
						With the release of ESO's <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Gold_Road">Gold Road</a> Chapter, hundreds of pages for <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Scions_of_Ithelia">Scions of Ithelia</a>, Gold Road, New Battlegrounds & Companions-related topics were created. Here were the main ones.

										Mirrormoor is a large desert wasteland filled with gargantuan skeletons and surrounded by an auroral sky. While Ithelia is active, it is filled by shattered mirrors and crystalline structures and the sky is fractured by cracks. Those elements were not present in Fargrave before Ithelia's return.

					<h2>Rare Merchandise</h2>

					<p>
						Merchandise is an aspect of TES that we didn't really document that well for the longest time. We're starting to turn that around. Here are some very rare pieces of Elder Scrolls memorabilia that are basically impossible to find in the real world, but are available for your perusal on the wiki.

									2024 was the 30th anniversary of The Elder Scrolls. On March 25th, we celebrated this milestone for the series, although it is a bit more complicated than that. March 25th is the official anniversary for the release of Arena, but there isn't truly an official release date. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Game release dates were not as set in stone in the past as they are now, and our research suggests that the game may have actually been out in February, with at least one person back then claiming that a patch for the game had already been distributed.

									This year was also the tenth anniversary of the release of Elder Scrolls Online. In early April, ZOS hosted the official ESO Tenth Anniversary Celebration Event in Amsterdam. A lot of us from UESP got a chance to meetup whilst there! It was a lot of fun meeting the devs and fellow community members. Baratron from UESP recorded her experience of the event <a href="https://blog.uesp.net/the-elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-preview/">here</a>.

									The UESP has begun the documentation process of the incredibly large amount of new content that Gold Road brought to The Elder Scrolls. ESO has an almost staggering amount of content, and working through it all to get it into a readable format is always a challenge. But we've made gigantic strides.

								<p>
									OneBGS USA announced a "wall to wall" union of every one of Bethesda's sites, following the previous successful unionization of QA workers for Zenimax. This follows years of brutal job cuts from studios across the gaming industry as a whole.

							<div class="text">
								<p>
									This year saw the release of <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Castles:Castles">The Elder Scrolls: Castles</a>, a game that aims at a slightly different market than traditional TES. It does bring us the first definitive models of the babies and youth of each race in a single game, a trait that was heavily featured in its marketing.
								</p>
								<p>
									We've done a lot to cover this game, being some of the first people to notice that it existed when it's surprise beta showed up on the Google Play store without any official announcement. We have some really difficult bits already getting decent coverage on the wiki, like the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Castles:Rulings">Rulings</a>. There's still more to do, but we have a decent leg up on this game so far.

						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="text">
								<p>
									A new physical Elder Scrolls book has been released. The Elder Scrolls: The Official Cookbook Vol. 2 is a followup to the first volume, but with a much heavier focus on lore. We aren't culinary experts, but we were still surprised to find such a heavy amount of lore flavor in a cookbook. This book also offers us one of the few glimpses into life across Tamriel in the Fourth Era, with some very surprising little details included. It really makes us hungry for the continuation of the Fourth Era storyline with TESVI.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Elder Scrolls has a growing number of various companion books, but only two actual novels. We'd really love to see that change...

					<h1>Traffic & Outages</h1>

					<p> 
						On the server side, we've had a relatively uneventful 2024, although with a few more outages than last year, resulting in a couple of hours of downtime for one or more servers overall.
					</p>

					<p> 
						Besides planned maintenance, all outages were the result of overzealous and poorly implemented bots/crawlers who either requested pages too quickly or requested CPU heavy content (like article diffs) that caused server load issues and either slow page loads or outright server outages.
					</p>

					<p>
						For now, these bots/crawlers have been dealt with by IP blocks. Most of them have been from China so large IP range blocks shouldn't affect our actual users.
					</p>

					<p>
						We've also disabled article diffs for anonymous users temporarily. In 2025 we want to look at better automatic protections that would prevent a poorly implemented crawler or malicious user from causing site slowdowns or outages.

					<h1>Thank You!</h1>

					<p> 
						Once again, we want to thank you for joining us in exploring Tamriel and beyond over the last year.
					</p>

					<p>
						2024 brought us the 30th anniversary of The Elder Scrolls, and 2025 will bring the 30th anniversary of the UESP. We've been walking this path from the earliest days of this series, and we've had literal generations of Elder Scrolls fans brought together in our community. It's an incredible privilege and opportunity, and we cannot thank you all enough for giving it to us.
					</p>

					<p>
						We do have some incredible plans for the UESP's future, but wherever those plans take us, we are happy that we get to work through our path with all of you. See you in Year 30!
					</p>
